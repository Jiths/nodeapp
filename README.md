This is based mostly on information from [Scott Smith's tutorial](http://scottksmith.com/blog/2014/10/05/twitatron-building-a-production-web-app-with-node/).

Also [Templating with ejs](https://coligo.io/templating-node-and-express-apps-with-ejs/).

Also, when using SQLite, remember to use parameters in your statements to ensure sanitization / avoid SQL injections (https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API, https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/issues/57)

Also some good information in the SQLite tutorial, e.g. http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-foreign-key/.

This seems to be super concise, complete and self-contained... but it uses MongoDB:
